EMPLOYEE SQL PROJECT

Introduction
As a new data engineer hire I'd like to thank the department heads of Pewlett Hackard for trusting me to be a part of your SQL database clean-up/analysis project.
Working on this project has made my first two weeks at this company very rewarding and I look forward to the road we have ahead. 

PROJECT GOAL 
Each of the team members were to do a research project about people whom the company employed during an assigned a date range. The tasks included collecting the remaining
data from the old employee database, import the CSV files into a new SQL database, design the tables to hold the data, and then answer questions about the data. Effectively,
performing data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

- Assigned date range:
1980s and 1990s
- Remaining data from that period
6 CSV files
